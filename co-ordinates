COORDINATES:
1)  x is latitude and y is longitude.
2)	Degrees latitude are numbered from 0째 to 90째 north and south.
3)	The longitude degrees continue 180째 east and 180째 west.


LATITUDES:
A change in latitude of:                                 Means a change in distance of:
 
1 degrees (N OR S)	69 miles or 111 km
0.1 degrees (N OR S)	6.9 miles
0.01 degrees (N OR S)	0.69 miles

Degrees= 1 means distance = 111km
IF we take meters:
Degrees= 0.001 means distance=111 meters
Degrees=0.00001 means distance=1.11meter
Or:
(0 degrees, 0 minutes, 0.036 seconds = 1.11 meter)

Changes in latitude remains same at all LATITUDES.


LONGITUDES:
A change in the longitude of 1 degree (E OR W) at this LATITUDE:    Means a change in distance 

0 degrees (equator)	69 miles
20 degrees north	65 miles
40 degrees north	53 miles
60 degrees north	35 miles
80 degrees north	12 miles
